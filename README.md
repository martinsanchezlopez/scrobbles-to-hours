<h4>Scrobbles to Hours is Last.fm tool to convert a user's scrobbles(playcount) to hours.</h4>
One can either get the playtime to his recently most listened tracks/albums or the alltime playtime a given album/track. Results are dependant on the user's data, any titles with metadata different from the official last.fm will not get picked up by the API and thus Scrobbles to Hours.
Results can be downloaded in csv format.  

\
Scrobbles to Hours was created with the [last.fm API](https://www.last.fm/api) and JQuery.\
If you fork this project you **MUST** get yourself a personal API account and key from the link above, and substitute them in the code for mine.
